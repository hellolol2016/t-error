   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PratikPaudel/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   Obtain your MongoDB connection details and API key, then add the following line to the `.env.local` file:

   ```dotenv
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Set up the shell:
   Run the command below to run on Ubunto WSL:
   ```
   g++ cpp-shell.cpp -l uuid -o shell -std=c++17 -lcurl

## Notes

### How to fix the libcurl linker error

If you are trying to build the shell and getting a long linked error output, it is likely because of libcurl. First you need to install it with

`brew install curl`

Then whenever you build the shell, you need to add it as a flag. To avoid warnings, also specify the std version to c++14 or newer

`g++ cpp-shell.cpp -o shell -std=c++17 -lcurl`
